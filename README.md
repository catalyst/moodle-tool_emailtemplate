# A html email footer generating plugin

## What is this plugin?

This is a very simple plugin that generates a chunk of html for each
user which they can use as their email footer. The html is generated
using a mustache template which can be customized.

The email footer takes values from the user profile fields and can
include custom profile fields like social links.

## View the footer html

Each user will get a new link on their profile to the new page:

/admin/tool/emailtemplate/index.php

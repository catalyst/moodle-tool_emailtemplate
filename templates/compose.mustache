        <p>This is a fake email with a bunch of text so you can kinda see what your email footer might look like.</p>
        <p>In reality it won't look <i>exactly</i> like this because styling html in emails is hard, and the html styles
            on this site won't be present in the email, but it is a rough guide at least. Really you need to send this
            email to someone and take a look in a few different email clients to test it properly.</p>
